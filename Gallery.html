      Van Heusen has created a tech-focused retail environment complete with "virtual try-on" mirrors and "style simulator" rooms. 
      On "virtual fitting" mirrors, customers' outfits can be previewed virtually in advance. 
      The "Style Simulator" room, which sounds like something out of a science fiction novel, 
      allows customers to try on day, night or night outfits, and even choose to turn on the occasion-appropriate music to accompany them and create the right mood.
