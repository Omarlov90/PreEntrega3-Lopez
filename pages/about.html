    <h2 id="About">Our story about creating a brand of ecological clothing</h2>
    <p class="main-content">
    <p>We founded our brand to be environmentally conscious and sustainable.</p>
    Backed by an environmentally conscious team, a love of contemporary clothing and a ton of pop,
    we've created a brand that's been thought out from start to finish. We only work with suppliers
    who share the same values ​​and are certified to reliable and legal social standards.
    A long-term partnership that allows us to grow together and build trust.
    This way we can sleep peacefully knowing that everyone involved in our brand will be treated with respect.
    To create a sustainable clothing brand, you need to have the right mindset. Once you decide to go the eco-friendly
    route,
    there is no turning back. Implementing sustainability in a brand means serious commitment.
    Either go all out, or don't go all out. Likewise, conscious customers, drawn to your brand values, want honesty,
    authenticity, and transparency.
    They want to know where your products are made, what materials they are made of,
    and they want to know your goals and plans so they can help you achieve it.
    <p>We aim to make sustainable fashion accessible to everyone.</p>
    Another reason why eco-conscious and sustainable fashion isn't fully ubiquitous is the lack of suitable options for
    plus-size,
    disabled and LGBTQ+ communities. Unless everyone is considered—
    whether target customers or brand leadership teams—sustainable fashion won’t be inclusive or accessible to everyone.
    Given this definition, sustainable fashion refers to a more environmentally friendly approach to designing,
    making and consuming clothing that ensures we do little to no damage to the planet and don't deplete all of its
    natural resources.
    Sustainable fashion also focuses on extending the lifespan of garments, using recyclable materials and general
    recycling.
    <p>We design and produce clothing with minimal environmental impact.</p>
    Unlike the fast fashion brands many of us are accustomed to buying from big box retailers,
    sustainable, eco-friendly fashion focuses on making clothing with minimal impact on the environment,
    while engaging in socially responsible business practices.
    As a sustainable clothing brand, we offer ecological and ethical clothing made from natural fibers
    while minimizing our impact on the environment. Our supplier Teemill uses renewable energy and organic farming to
    supply and deliver our clothing.
    The entire production process of Seed to Shop can be carried out here.
