      <h2>Our ecological clothing is made of natural materials and provides you with environmental benefits.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Natural and sustainable textiles: Choose items that are made from natural fibers (cotton, wool, linen, silk) and
        have some sustainability story, such as cotton denim made with less water; Viscose, rayon or modal from old
        forest pulp; non-toxic or leather alternatives such as pinatex made from pineapple. Note that just because fiber
        comes from plants or animals doesn't mean it's sustainable! For example, as you know from the statistics earlier
        in this article, regular cotton is very dense in water and chemicals.
        Sustainable brands, on the other hand, often use materials made from natural or recyclable sources that require
        far less or no chemical treatment, less water, less energy, and require no fertilizer to grow or pesticides.
        Most organic fabrics like linen, hemp, organic cotton and TENCEL™ (made from sustainable pulp) are even
        biodegradable. These eco-friendly fabrics are good for the planet and an amazing sustainable alternative.
        Eco-friendly clothing is all the rage these days, and as the world, the economy, and our daily lives change,
        eco-friendly clothing makes sense. Organic and recycled clothing is a beautiful way to be earth-friendly while
        staying stylish and trendy with your friends. Styles range from plain white T-shirts, polo shirts and bamboo
        hats to clothing made from recycled plastic bottles. As with anything, there are downsides to eco-friendly
        clothing, eg. B. It's slightly more expensive for consumers, but there are good reasons for more organic
        clothing compared to the benefits. I'm pretty sure the price will drop.

        <p>Before the development of mass production,
          almost all of our clothes were handmade. Today, many of us wouldn't think to delve into ancient techniques
          like knitting,
          sewing or weaving to make our own clothes, but participating in these creative endeavors is great for us and
          better for the planet.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12">
        <p>Repairing our own clothes extends their lifespan, which means we can buy less,
          reduce the need for manufacturing, and limit greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impact.
          Additionally, by making our own clothes, we can choose fabrics with a lower carbon footprint,
          such as those produced locally or using more sustainable processes.</p>

        <p>Clothing, shoes and accessories that are manufactured,
          sold and used as sustainably as possible, taking into account ecological and socio-economic aspects.
          In practice, this means continuous efforts to improve all stages of the product life cycle,
          from design, raw material extraction, manufacturing, transportation, storage,
          marketing and final sale to the use, reuse, repair, redesign and recycling of products and their products.</p>

        <p>But what we spend — and what we don't spend —
          can help make a positive difference for the people and resources involved in making our clothes.
          So when we need to update our wardrobes, we turn to slow fashion brands, like the 35 sustainable fashion
          brands below.
          Every fashion brand has made it a core part of its mission to produce clothing in an ethical
          and transparent manner that respects people and the planet. Many of these ethical clothing brands also have
          third-party sustainable and ethical certifications.</p>
